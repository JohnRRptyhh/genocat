If you would like to edit or add a tool to GenoCAT, fork our repository on <a href="https://github.com/hms-dbmi/genocat">Github</a>.
Using <a href="https://github.com/hms-dbmi/genocat/blob/master/template.md">template.md</a>, create a markdown file for your tool and upload it into _tools.
In assets, upload a screenshot of your tool and make sure the "images: " frontmatter in
your markdown file has the correct path (ex. /assets/imagename.png). Create a new
branch for your commit and start a pull request to the staging branch.
