abstract: "Methods for visualizing protein or nucleic acid motifs have traditionally relied upon residue frequencies to graphically scale character heights. We describe the pLogo, a motif visualization in which residue heights are scaled relative to their statistical significance. A pLogo generation tool is publicly available at http://plogo.uconn.edu/ and supports real-time conditional probability calculations and visualizations."
