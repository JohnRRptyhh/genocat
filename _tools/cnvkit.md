abstract: "Summary: The amount of gene and genome data obtained by next-generation sequencing technologies generates a need for comparative visualization tools. Complementing existing software for comparison and exploration of genomics data, genoPlotR automatically creates publication-grade linear maps of gene and genomes, in a highly automatic, flexible and reproducible way., , Availability: genoPlotR is a platform-independent R package, available with full source code under a GPL2 license at R-Forge: http://genoplotr.r-forge.r-project.org/"
