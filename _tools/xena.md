abstract: "UCSC Xena is a web-based visual integration and exploration tool for multi-omic data and associated clinical and phenotypic annotations. The platform consists of a web-based Xena Browser and turn-key Xena Hubs. Xena showcases seminal cancer genomics datasets from TCGA, Pan-Cancer Atlas, PCAWG, ICGC, and the GDC; a total of more than 1500 datasets across 50 cancer types. We support virtually any functional genomics data modality, including SNVs, INDELs, large structural variants, CNV, gene-and other types of expression, DNA methylation, clinical and phenotypic annotations. A researcher can host their own data securely via a private hub on a laptop or behind a firewall, with visual and analytical integration occurring only within the Xena Browser. Browser features include our high performance Visual Spreadsheet, dynamic Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, powerful filtering and subgrouping, statistical analyses, genomic signatures, bookmarks, box plots, and scatter plots."
